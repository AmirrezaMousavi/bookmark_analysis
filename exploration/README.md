Setup
=======

You will need the following dependencies:

* pip install beautifulsoup4
* pip install click
* pip install networkx
* pip install nltk
* pip install numpy
* pip install requests

And then download nltk data (python cli is easiest way):

* nltk.download() 

Note: Be aware there is a 2.1 GB corpus hiding amidst the
      rest. I think you only need the punkt one.
